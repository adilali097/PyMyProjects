# Corn-AI Image Generator

This project integrates a LLaMA-based image generator into a Node.js server. The system allows users to generate images based on text prompts using a Python script. The generated images can be retrieved via an HTTP endpoint exposed by the Node.js server.

## Features

- **Python Integration**: Utilizes a Python script to generate images based on text prompts.
- **Express Server**: Exposes a RESTful API endpoint to interact with the image generator.
- **LLaMA-Based Image Generation**: Although currently simulated, the project is designed to integrate with LLaMA for real-time image generation.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Can be deployed locally or on any platform supporting Node.js and Python.

## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- Python (v3.x)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Python libraries: `pillow`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/corn-ai-image-generator.git
   cd corn-ai-image-generator
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

4. **Verify Python Installation**:
   Ensure that Python is installed and accessible via the `python3` command. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Node.js server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Make a POST request to generate an image**:
   You can use tools like `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to the server:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/generate-image -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Your prompt here"}'
   ```

3. **Receive the generated image**:
   The server will process the request and return a generated image based on the provided prompt.

## API

### `POST /generate-image`

**Description**: Generates an image based on the provided text prompt.

**Request Body**:
- `prompt`: A string containing the text prompt for the image generation.

**Response**:
- Returns a binary image in PNG format.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "prompt": "A futuristic city skyline"
}
```
